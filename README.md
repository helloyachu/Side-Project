# Hello, everyone!
Welcome to my Side-Project repository, here is a small work I made in my free time.

Regarding Web Design, I reconstructed the web design cases - Musen Design and Pear Cafe.

In musen.html, RWD developed the desktop version first, and then developed the tablet version and the mobile version separately. The optimal display size for the desktop version is 1707px*940px. The optimal display size for tablet version is 854px*947px. The optimal display size of the mobile version is 500px*947px. The screen zoom ratio is 150%.

About pearcafe, a tablet version has been developed. The optimal display size is 854px*947px and the screen scaling ratio is 100%. In addition to the home page, it also includes the following pages as shown below, About the store, branch information, menu, store activities, services provided, lectures, etc., with a total of fifteen switching paging settings.

Regarding Web Crawler, you can see the complete code and the output after executing the program file, with image or .csv files.

In the side-project-order.py, you can see information about web crawling order, it’s a web page about Interior design.
